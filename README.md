# Digital_Clock-Project

The code starts by creating a Tkinter window with the root as its parent.

 The title of this window is "Clock".
 
 Next, it creates a function called time() that will be executed every second.
 
 This function takes in one parameter which is the current time and returns a string representation of that time.
 
 It then configures the Label object lbl to display this string on its text attribute.
 
 After 1000 milliseconds, it displays another message for 1 second before repeating again.
 
 The main loop starts at line 18 and continues until there are no more events to process or until the user closes the program (line 22).
 
 The code is meant to run the time() function every second.
 
 The code above does not have any errors and compiles successfully.
